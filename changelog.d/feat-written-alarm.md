### Added

- **A loud warning when something wrote to the disk.** A copy of the boot regions, FAT, bitmap and root directory is kept beside the baseline. When the disk later differs, a red panel on every screen says how many clusters that were free now hold other data, which top-level entries changed, and which found files used those clusters. The map marks those files as overwritten or partial, a file test from before the write no longer counts for them, and the structures are read again every ten minutes. The `structure_changes` tool gives the same detail.

### Fixed

- **Owners of a cluster include chains claimed from their middle.** A deleted entry whose first cluster lies inside another file's FAT chain was missed when asking who claims one of that chain's clusters.
