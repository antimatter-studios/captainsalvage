### Added

- **Who else claims a file's clusters.** The new `conflicts` tool lists, for one file, every other entry that claims any of its clusters: its verdict, whether it is deleted, when it was made, its size, the runs of clusters it shares, and who holds them by the map's rule. It also says how many shared clusters hold directory entries and what the shared clusters hold now.
- **The script reference lists every field its functions return**, and warns that Rhai reserves some words such as `shared`. A test checks the reference against the real output, and another checks that the ownership map and `owners` agree.
